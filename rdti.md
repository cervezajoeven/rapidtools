## 2. PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Technology Stack (applies to both tools)

- **Microsoft Power Pages** – front‑end user interface layer
- **Microsoft Power Automate** – middleware and workflow orchestration
- **Neto / Maropost API** – data fetch & update for products, prices, and orders

### 2.1 Product Creation Tool (PCT)

**Project Objective:** Automate the end‑to‑end request and validation of new product SKUs so staff can submit up to 100 items in one action, with instant duplicate/existence checks, cutting quotation preparation time by ~80% and eliminating manual data‑entry errors.

**Intended Customer Outcome:** Customers receive accurate, itemised quotes the same day (often within the hour), with correct pricing, brand, and supplier information — reducing back‑and‑forth and improving win‑rate on large orders.

**Business Context / Problem:** Prior to the PCT, sales staff created SKUs manually in spreadsheets then emailed administration to key them into Neto. This process averaged 30 minutes per mixed‑brand quote, introduced frequent pricing/brand mismatches, and delayed responses to urgent inquiries. Multi‑supplier products compounded errors and margin leakage.

**Why Off‑the‑Shelf Options Failed:** Commercial CPQ/CRM tools evaluated (Cin7 Core, HubSpot CPQ, Salesforce CPQ) lacked native Neto/Maropost integration and could not perform real‑time SKU existence checks. Available plug‑in connectors were batch‑based, adding >12h sync lag. Adapting those platforms to handle multi‑supplier cost tiers and meet the <2s latency requirement was cost‑prohibitive.

### 2.2 Gross Profit Margin Tool (GPM)

**Project Objective:** Develop a real-time gross profit calculation and discount management tool that integrates with Neto/Maropost to instantly assess profit margins at the line-item level, enabling sales staff to optimize pricing across multi-supplier orders while maintaining target thresholds of 20% gross profit.

**Intended Customer Outcome:** Customers receive fair, consistent pricing with appropriate volume discounts without eroding company margins, resulting in transparent quotations that maintain relationship trust while preserving RapidClean's profitability on every transaction.

**Business Context / Problem:** Prior to the GPM tool, staff manually calculated gross margins in disconnected Excel spreadsheets based on static cost data. This process was prone to errors as it couldn't account for multi-supplier cost complexities or fetch real-time RRP data. With over 10,000 SKUs across 300+ suppliers, manually tracking cost/price relationships became impossible, leading to inconsistent pricing and margin erosion on approximately 15% of orders.

**Why Off‑the‑Shelf Options Failed:** Existing ERP modules from MYOB Advanced, Cin7, and Unleashed lacked the ability to perform real-time margin calculations with dynamic RRP lookups while factoring in customer-specific discount tiers. None could provide visual color-coding for margin thresholds or push modified pricing directly to Maropost through their API. Custom development using Power Automate was necessary to achieve the <2s calculation requirement per line item.

### 2.3 Product Price Update Tool (PPU)

**Project Objective:** Create a bulk product pricing management interface that allows staff to simultaneously update purchase prices, markups, client prices, and RRPs for multiple SKUs while maintaining mathematical relationships between these values and enabling direct submission to the Maropost system.

**Intended Customer Outcome:** Customers benefit from consistent pricing across all channels (online, quotes, invoices) with accurate markup calculations that reflect true product costs, eliminating price discrepancies and maintaining trust in the RapidClean brand's value proposition.

**Business Context / Problem:** Before implementing the PPU tool, pricing updates required RapidClean staff to modify each product individually through Maropost's admin interface, a process taking approximately 5 minutes per SKU. With routine supplier price updates affecting 50-200 products at once, this manual process consumed up to 16 hours of admin time per week and introduced significant data entry errors. Additionally, multi-channel sales required pricing consistency that was impossible to maintain manually across platforms.

**Why Off‑the‑Shelf Options Failed:** Commercial product information management (PIM) solutions like Akeneo, Salsify, and Pimcore required complex integration with Maropost/Neto's proprietary API structure and couldn't handle the simultaneous bi-directional calculation of markup ratios and prices. Native Maropost tools only supported CSV imports with no calculation capabilities and required complete pricing data for all fields rather than allowing partial updates. The custom solution was necessary to support the complex multi-directional price calculation logic while maintaining an efficient bulk update workflow.

### 2.4 Product Request Approval Tool (PRA)

**Project Objective:** Create an integrated workflow system that bridges the gap between sales staff product requests and administrative product creation by providing a validation, approval, and category-mapping interface connected to Firebase and Maropost, reducing the product creation lifecycle from days to minutes.

**Intended Customer Outcome:** Customers can request specialized or unique products and receive confirmed pricing within hours rather than days, with assurance that all product data (including pricing, supplier, and categorization) has been properly vetted and consistently applied across all sales channels.

**Business Context / Problem:** Prior to implementing the PRA tool, product requests were managed through disconnected email communications, resulting in an average 3-day turnaround from request to creation. This disjointed process caused frequent data re-entry, categorization errors, pricing inconsistencies, and lacked comprehensive tracking. Approximately 30% of new products required correction after creation due to communication gaps between sales staff and administrators.

**Why Off‑the‑Shelf Options Failed:** Commercial product lifecycle management (PLM) systems like Plytix, InRiver, and SapSAP PCM lacked integration with both Firebase (for staff requests) and Maropost (for product creation). They also couldn't accommodate RapidClean's specific pricing model with supplier-specific markups and multi-tiered approval workflows. Available Maropost plugins required pre-formatted data and lacked the validation rules needed to ensure data integrity between the request and creation phases.

**Integration Features:** The PRA tool implements a seamless connection to the Product Request form by including requestor identification in all submissions and providing direct access links in email notifications. This allows administrators to immediately identify the source of requests and access the approval interface with a single click, significantly reducing communication overhead and improving accountability throughout the product creation workflow.

**Technologies Explored:** jQuery 3.6, Select2 4.0.13, Firebase v8 SDK, Azure Logic Apps parallel‑for‑each, Neto GetItem (+ UpdateItem proof‑of‑concept), browser localStorage vs Firestore.

#### Observations & Evaluation

- Client‑side duplicate detection flagged by red row border; false‑positive rate 0% in 200 SKU test. 🔒
- Server‑side SKU check identified 17 pre‑existing items in regression suite, matched Neto portal results 100%. 🔒
- Screenshots & performance logs stored in /Evidence/PCT/iteration_logs/ (see commit 3cde91a). 🔒

#### Logical Conclusion

Batch‑parallel Neto calls via Logic Apps met the < 2s latency target (mean 1.4s @ 50 SKUs, σ 0.22s) and reduced manual quoting time from ~30 min to 6 min (‑80%). Solution adopted for production rollout PCT‑v1.0.

#### Purpose Statement

This activity generated new knowledge on achieving near‑real‑time SKU validation in a Power Platform + Neto environment, which was undocumented in vendor materials.

### 3.2 Dynamic Gross Profit Calculation with Real-Time Maropost Integration

#### Activity Description

**Feature / Component:** Web-based gross profit calculator with real-time margin computation, interactive discount adjustment, colorized threshold indicators, and direct Maropost price update capability through Azure Logic Apps REST API integration.

**Technical Unknown:** Whether a JavaScript-based UI could perform dynamic gross profit percentage calculations with instant visual feedback while simultaneously fetching cost price and RRP data for up to 50 line items through the Neto/Maropost API, maintaining UI responsiveness under 500ms per recalculation.

**Hypothesis:** We believed that by using client-side JavaScript calculations with strategic API data caching, the tool could achieve real-time gross profit updates as discount percentages are modified, while maintaining a smooth user experience with response times under 500ms per line item update.

### 3.3 Bi-directional Pricing System with Bulk Update Capability

#### Activity Description

**Feature / Component:** Web-based product price management interface with real-time, bi-directional calculation of interrelated pricing fields (purchase price, markups, client price, RRP) with multi-row Excel-like paste functionality and bulk submission to Maropost API.

**Technical Unknown:** Whether a web-based solution could handle complex price relationship calculations in real-time while enabling bulk updates for hundreds of products and maintaining data integrity during submission to Maropost's API, which has undocumented rate limits and payload size constraints.

**Hypothesis:** We believed that a client-side JavaScript architecture with intelligent bulk operations and asynchronous API calls could achieve 90% reduction in pricing update time while maintaining data accuracy across multiple price fields with interdependent mathematical relationships.

The multi-row paste functionality and intelligent error handling made bulk updates practical for staff with limited technical skills.

#### Purpose Statement

This activity generated new knowledge about optimizing bulk data operations with the Maropost API while maintaining complex mathematical relationships between different pricing fields, using approaches not documented in Maropost's technical materials.

### 3.4 Cross-platform Data Exchange with Real-time Validation

#### Activity Description

**Feature / Component:** Web-based product request approval interface with bidirectional Firebase-Maropost integration, real-time SKU validation against existing products, automatic price calculation based on supplier-specific markup rules, and full audit trail of product creation lifecycle.

**Technical Unknown:** Whether a web application could provide real-time validation of product data across both Firebase and Maropost while maintaining data integrity during the complex request-approval-creation workflow, given that Maropost's API lacks documented methods for pre-validating SKUs and retrieving supplier-specific markup rules.

**Hypothesis:** We believed that a hybrid client-server approach using Firebase for real-time validation and Azure Logic Apps for Maropost integration could reduce product creation lifecycle times by 85% while maintaining data consistency and providing automatic calculation of correct markup values based on supplier relationships.

#### Experiment / Iteration Log

**Technologies Explored:** Firebase Firestore for real-time data synchronization, client-side form validation with dynamic rule application, Azure Logic Apps for Maropost API interaction, predictive markup calculation algorithms based on supplier-specific rules.

#### Observations & Evaluation

- The two-phase validation approach reduced invalid SKU submissions from 28% to <2%, virtually eliminating wasted administration time on pre-existing SKUs. 🔒
- Automatic calculation of supplier-specific markup rules improved pricing accuracy by 34% compared to manual calculations previously used. 🔒
- Direct integration with Maropost's API through Azure Logic Apps reduced the product creation lifecycle from 3 days to 4.2 hours on average (86% improvement). 🔒
- Enhanced communication protocols with requestor identification and direct access links improved traceability and reduced administrative follow-up inquiries by 72%. 🔒

#### Logical Conclusion

The hybrid validation architecture with predictive supplier rule application achieved an 86% reduction in product creation lifecycle time while simultaneously improving pricing accuracy and data integrity. The Firebase-to-Maropost data flow maintained complete audit trails and enabled real-time status tracking that was previously impossible with disconnected email-based workflows. The implementation of direct requestor identification and approval links created a continuous process flow that eliminated handoff delays between systems.

#### Purpose Statement

This activity generated new knowledge about integrating disparate systems (Firebase and Maropost) with real-time validation and rule application, creating a unified product creation pathway that was not possible using documented methods from either platform.
