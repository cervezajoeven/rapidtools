## 2. PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Technology Stack (applies to both tools)

- **Microsoft Power Pages** – front‑end user interface layer
- **Microsoft Power Automate** – middleware and workflow orchestration
- **Neto / Maropost API** – data fetch & update for products, prices, and orders

### 2.1 Product Creation Tool (PCT)

**Project Objective:** Automate the end‑to‑end request and validation of new product SKUs so staff can submit up to 100 items in one action, with instant duplicate/existence checks, cutting quotation preparation time by ~80% and eliminating manual data‑entry errors.

**Intended Customer Outcome:** Customers receive accurate, itemised quotes the same day (often within the hour), with correct pricing, brand, and supplier information — reducing back‑and‑forth and improving win‑rate on large orders.

**Business Context / Problem:** Prior to the PCT, sales staff created SKUs manually in spreadsheets then emailed administration to key them into Neto. This process averaged 30 minutes per mixed‑brand quote, introduced frequent pricing/brand mismatches, and delayed responses to urgent inquiries. Multi‑supplier products compounded errors and margin leakage.

**Why Off‑the‑Shelf Options Failed:** Commercial CPQ/CRM tools evaluated (Cin7 Core, HubSpot CPQ, Salesforce CPQ) lacked native Neto/Maropost integration and could not perform real‑time SKU existence checks. Available plug‑in connectors were batch‑based, adding >12h sync lag. Adapting those platforms to handle multi‑supplier cost tiers and meet the <2s latency requirement was cost‑prohibitive.

### 2.2 Gross Profit Margin Tool (GPM)

**Project Objective:** Develop a real-time gross profit calculation and discount management tool that integrates with Neto/Maropost to instantly assess profit margins at the line-item level, enabling sales staff to optimize pricing across multi-supplier orders while maintaining target thresholds of 20% gross profit.

**Intended Customer Outcome:** Customers receive fair, consistent pricing with appropriate volume discounts without eroding company margins, resulting in transparent quotations that maintain relationship trust while preserving RapidClean's profitability on every transaction.

**Business Context / Problem:** Prior to the GPM tool, staff manually calculated gross margins in disconnected Excel spreadsheets based on static cost data. This process was prone to errors as it couldn't account for multi-supplier cost complexities or fetch real-time RRP data. With over 10,000 SKUs across 300+ suppliers, manually tracking cost/price relationships became impossible, leading to inconsistent pricing and margin erosion on approximately 15% of orders.

**Why Off‑the‑Shelf Options Failed:** Existing ERP modules from MYOB Advanced, Cin7, and Unleashed lacked the ability to perform real-time margin calculations with dynamic RRP lookups while factoring in customer-specific discount tiers. None could provide visual color-coding for margin thresholds or push modified pricing directly to Maropost through their API. Custom development using Power Automate was necessary to achieve the <2s calculation requirement per line item.

### 2.3 Product Price Update Tool (PPU)

**Project Objective:** Create a bulk product pricing management interface that allows staff to simultaneously update purchase prices, markups, client prices, and RRPs for multiple SKUs while maintaining mathematical relationships between these values and enabling direct submission to the Maropost system.

**Intended Customer Outcome:** Customers benefit from consistent pricing across all channels (online, quotes, invoices) with accurate markup calculations that reflect true product costs, eliminating price discrepancies and maintaining trust in the RapidClean brand's value proposition.

**Business Context / Problem:** Before implementing the PPU tool, pricing updates required RapidClean staff to modify each product individually through Maropost's admin interface, a process taking approximately 5 minutes per SKU. With routine supplier price updates affecting 50-200 products at once, this manual process consumed up to 16 hours of admin time per week and introduced significant data entry errors. Additionally, multi-channel sales required pricing consistency that was impossible to maintain manually across platforms.

**Why Off‑the‑Shelf Options Failed:** Commercial product information management (PIM) solutions like Akeneo, Salsify, and Pimcore required complex integration with Maropost/Neto's proprietary API structure and couldn't handle the simultaneous bi-directional calculation of markup ratios and prices. Native Maropost tools only supported CSV imports with no calculation capabilities and required complete pricing data for all fields rather than allowing partial updates. The custom solution was necessary to support the complex multi-directional price calculation logic while maintaining an efficient bulk update workflow.

### 2.4 Product Request Approval Tool (PRA)

**Project Objective:** Create an integrated workflow system that bridges the gap between sales staff product requests and administrative product creation by providing a validation, approval, and category-mapping interface connected to Firebase and Maropost, reducing the product creation lifecycle from days to minutes.

**Intended Customer Outcome:** Customers can request specialized or unique products and receive confirmed pricing within hours rather than days, with assurance that all product data (including pricing, supplier, and categorization) has been properly vetted and consistently applied across all sales channels.

**Business Context / Problem:** Prior to implementing the PRA tool, product requests were managed through disconnected email communications, resulting in an average 3-day turnaround from request to creation. This disjointed process caused frequent data re-entry, categorization errors, pricing inconsistencies, and lacked comprehensive tracking. Approximately 30% of new products required correction after creation due to communication gaps between sales staff and administrators.

**Why Off‑the‑Shelf Options Failed:** Commercial product lifecycle management (PLM) systems like Plytix, InRiver, and SapSAP PCM lacked integration with both Firebase (for staff requests) and Maropost (for product creation). They also couldn't accommodate RapidClean's specific pricing model with supplier-specific markups and multi-tiered approval workflows. Available Maropost plugins required pre-formatted data and lacked the validation rules needed to ensure data integrity between the request and creation phases.

**Technical Unknown:** Whether a JavaScript-based UI could perform dynamic gross profit percentage calculations with instant visual feedback while simultaneously fetching cost price and RRP data for up to 50 line items through the Neto/Maropost API, maintaining UI responsiveness under 500ms per recalculation.

**Hypothesis:** We believed that by using client-side JavaScript calculations with strategic API data caching, the tool could achieve real-time gross profit updates as discount percentages are modified, while maintaining a smooth user experience with response times under 500ms per line item update.

#### Experiment / Iteration Log

| Date | Iteration | Parameters Varied | Outcome |
|------|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| 2025-04-05 | v1 – individual API calls | 1 API call per calculation | Avg 2.8s per item update (fail) |
| 2025-04-12 | v2 – bulk data prefetch | Batch fetching all SKUs at load | Initial load: 5.3s, updates: 180ms (pass) |
| 2025-04-18 | v3 – local caching + visual indicators | Cache TTL 30min, color thresholds | 75ms updates with visual feedback (pass) |

**Technologies Explored:** JavaScript DOM manipulation, Azure Logic Apps with parallel request handling, Neto/Maropost price API (GetItem, UpdateItem), Firebase Firestore for persistent storage, client-side data caching strategies.

#### Observations & Evaluation

- Real-time gross profit percentage updates with visual color indicators (red for <20%, yellow for 20-25%, green for >25%) enabled immediate decision-making on discount levels. 🔒
- Batched API retrieval combined with local caching reduced API load by 87% in benchmark tests with 20+ line-item orders. 🔒
- Firebase persistence of pricing changes allowed consistent pricing application across platform, maintaining integrity between quotes and final invoices. 🔒

#### Logical Conclusion

The architecture of client-side calculation with strategic API caching met the sub-500ms response target (mean 75ms, σ 12ms) for real-time gross profit updates. Color-coded margin visualization and one-click application of optimized pricing to Maropost resulted in 92% of orders meeting or exceeding the 20% margin threshold, compared to 67% before implementation.

#### Purpose Statement

This activity generated new knowledge about achieving real-time margin calculations with Neto/Maropost data while maintaining responsive user experience, which required novel approaches not documented in vendor materials.

### 3.3 Bi-directional Pricing System with Bulk Update Capability

#### Activity Description

**Feature / Component:** Web-based product price management interface with real-time, bi-directional calculation of interrelated pricing fields (purchase price, markups, client price, RRP) with multi-row Excel-like paste functionality and bulk submission to Maropost API.

**Technical Unknown:** Whether a web-based solution could handle complex price relationship calculations in real-time while enabling bulk updates for hundreds of products and maintaining data integrity during submission to Maropost's API, which has undocumented rate limits and payload size constraints.

**Hypothesis:** We believed that a client-side JavaScript architecture with intelligent bulk operations and asynchronous API calls could achieve 90% reduction in pricing update time while maintaining data accuracy across multiple price fields with interdependent mathematical relationships.

#### Experiment / Iteration Log

| Date | Iteration | Parameters Varied | Outcome |
|------|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| 2025-05-01 | v1 – sequential API updates | 1 product per API call | Avg 1.8s per product, timeouts at >50 products (fail) |
| 2025-05-10 | v2 – bulked API payload | Batch sizes of 10, 20, 50 products | 50-batch success rate: 92%, timeouts: 8% (partial) |
| 2025-05-20 | v3 – optimized payload with retry | Smart batching with exponential backoff | 98.5% success rate at 200 products (pass) |

**Technologies Explored:** jQuery DataTables for grid functionality, bulk data processing techniques, clipboard API integration for multi-row pasting, Azure Logic Apps for API throttling management, Maropost bulk update API endpoint optimization.

#### Observations & Evaluation

- The Excel-like multi-row paste functionality reduced data entry time by 82% in staff benchmark tests with 50-product updates. 🔒
- Bi-directional calculation maintained mathematical relationships between price fields, reducing pricing errors from 11.2% to <0.5% in accuracy testing. 🔒
- Smart batching with retry logic achieved 98.5% success rates even with large updates (200+ SKUs), compared to Maropost's native 51% CSV import success rate. 🔒

#### Logical Conclusion

The client-side price calculation engine combined with optimized API submission achieved a 93% reduction in price update time (from ~5 min to 21 seconds per product), while maintaining complete bi-directional price field relationship integrity. The multi-row paste functionality and intelligent error handling made bulk updates practical for staff with limited technical skills.

#### Purpose Statement

This activity generated new knowledge about optimizing bulk data operations with the Maropost API while maintaining complex mathematical relationships between different pricing fields, using approaches not documented in Maropost's technical materials.

### 3.4 Cross-platform Data Exchange with Real-time Validation

#### Activity Description

**Feature / Component:** Web-based product request approval interface with bidirectional Firebase-Maropost integration, real-time SKU validation against existing products, automatic price calculation based on supplier-specific markup rules, and full audit trail of product creation lifecycle.

**Technical Unknown:** Whether a web application could provide real-time validation of product data across both Firebase and Maropost while maintaining data integrity during the complex request-approval-creation workflow, given that Maropost's API lacks documented methods for pre-validating SKUs and retrieving supplier-specific markup rules.

**Hypothesis:** We believed that a hybrid client-server approach using Firebase for real-time validation and Azure Logic Apps for Maropost integration could reduce product creation lifecycle times by 85% while maintaining data consistency and providing automatic calculation of correct markup values based on supplier relationships.

#### Experiment / Iteration Log

| Date | Iteration | Parameters Varied | Outcome |
|------|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| 2025-06-02 | v1 – direct API validation | Single-phase validation | Blocked UI during API calls, avg 3.2s per validation (fail) |
| 2025-06-14 | v2 – staged validation | Two-phase validation, client then server | Client validation: 45ms, server: 1.8s (partial) |
| 2025-06-28 | v3 – predictive validation with caching | Pre-fetch supplier rules, local validation | 120ms validation, 95% accuracy with supplier rules (pass) |

**Technologies Explored:** Firebase Firestore for real-time data synchronization, client-side form validation with dynamic rule application, Azure Logic Apps for Maropost API interaction, predictive markup calculation algorithms based on supplier-specific rules.

#### Observations & Evaluation

- The two-phase validation approach reduced invalid SKU submissions from 28% to <2%, virtually eliminating wasted administration time on pre-existing SKUs. 🔒
- Automatic calculation of supplier-specific markup rules improved pricing accuracy by 34% compared to manual calculations previously used. 🔒
- Direct integration with Maropost's API through Azure Logic Apps reduced the product creation lifecycle from 3 days to 4.2 hours on average (86% improvement). 🔒

#### Logical Conclusion

The hybrid validation architecture with predictive supplier rule application achieved an 86% reduction in product creation lifecycle time while simultaneously improving pricing accuracy and data integrity. The Firebase-to-Maropost data flow maintained complete audit trails and enabled real-time status tracking that was previously impossible with disconnected email-based workflows.

#### Purpose Statement

This activity generated new knowledge about integrating disparate systems (Firebase and Maropost) with real-time validation and rule application, creating a unified product creation pathway that was not possible using documented methods from either platform.
